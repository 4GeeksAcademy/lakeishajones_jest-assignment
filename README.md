Unit testing with Jest
Important: ðŸ’» This exercise is interactive. Please follow the instructions.

Most developers today are required not only to write code, but also need to write code to test their own code ðŸ˜±, yes... really.

Today we are going to be using the Jest framework to create our first tests.

ðŸŒ± How to start this project
This project comes with the necessary files to start working immediately.

We recommend opening this very same repository using a provisioning tool like Codespaces (recommended) or Gitpod. Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the git clone command.

This is the repository you need to open:

https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-unit-test-with-jest
ðŸ‘‰ Please follow these steps on how to start a coding project.

ðŸ’¡ Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (git remote set-url origin <your new url>), and uploading the code to your new repository using the add, commit and push commands from the git terminal.

Then follow these instructions:

Get into the exercise folder: $ cd exercise-unit-test-with-jest
Download learnpack globally (if you don't have it already): $ npm i @learnpack/learnpack -g
Start the exercise: $ learnpack start
What is this exercise about?
We are going to be using the Jest library to build a program capable of converting numeric values from one currency to another:

Function name	Description
fromDollarToYen	Receives a dollar amount and returns the equivalent amount in Japan Yen
fromEuroToDollar	Receives a Euro amount and returns the equivalent amount in US Dollar
fromYenToPound	Receives a Yen amount and returns the equivalent amount in England Pound
This and many other projects are built by students as part of the 4Geeks Academy Coding Bootcamp by Alejandro Sanchez and many other contributors. Find out more about our Full Stack Developer Course, and Data Science Bootcamp.
